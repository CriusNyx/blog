# Doing Cool Things (with Markdown 2)

In part one I engineered a solution to enable component embedding to markdown documents. However, 
there are still some features I found myself wanting from my original solution. First, I couldn't
customize metadata about the document such as what title string to display, and customizing 
[slugs](## "A slug is a unique shorthand to identify a resource in a computer system. Slugs are used in my note software for link shorthands.") 
for the document.

## Directives

Directives are a feature in computer programming languages that customize the behavior of the source
code before it's fed into a compiler. For example, in C# directives can be used to conditionally 
compile code.

For example, consider this example that adds additional GUI elements in the Unity Editor.

```csharp
using UntyEngine;
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using UnityEditor;
#endif

class MyComponent: MonoBehavior {
  void OnSceneGUI(){
    #if UNITY_EDITOR
    // This code will only work in the editor.
    // We can use directives to include it only in the editor.
    EditorGuiLayout.ColorField();
    #endif
  }
}
```

Directives are a convenient way to create a variety of different output documents from a single 
source code file.

We can use directives in markdown to implement some of the following features.

- Customize what sections of the document are public, and what are private.
- Customize the title of the document, and other meta data.
- Enable or disable feature flags for particular features.
- Embed other markdown documents

### Syntax

To enable directives in markdown the first thing I needed to do was find a syntax for declaring one
that doesn't already have a special meaning in markdown. I used the @ symbol.

For example, this document on my notetaking app customizes it's title using the `@title` directive.

<Row>
  <Col>
  ```markdown
  @title "This is my title"

  Here is my doc text.
  ```
  </Col>
  <Col>
    ![title](/blog/doingCoolThingsWithMarkdown2/title.png)
  </Col>
</Row>

I can also customize the visibility of elements in the document using the `@dm` and `@player` 
directives.

```markdown
@title "Market"

The market is located on the south side of town.

@dm

## DMNotes

When the players approach the market for the first time there is a crowd outside looking for a 
scammer who can no longer be found at the market.

@player

## Shop Items

The shop has the following items.
```

We can see what it looks like in the finished page below.

<Row>
  <Col>
  ### For DM
