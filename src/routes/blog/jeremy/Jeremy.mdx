# Jeremy

## Therapists office

The therapist enters the office. Inside are two men in shorts who are conspicuously looking away 
from each other.

<Dialog>

  <Therapist>
    What brings the two of you in for counseling?
  </Therapist>

  <Mick>
    He fucked Jeremy.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    He fucked Jeremy.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    How ... Rude!
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    All I'm saying is he tastes better.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    *to therapist* He does, he's on that keto diet.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
  Maybe if you ate less garlic.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>  
    Bitch, you know you love it.
  </Mick>

</Dialog>

A long pause follows. The therapist takes some notes, and then breaks the silence.

<Dialog>

  <Therapist>
    Is Jeremy a friend of yours?
  </Therapist>

  <Mick>
    A friend of his maybe.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    Girl, you were bowling with that man yesterday.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>  
    You know, you could be bowling me put in the effort.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    You're just don't like my new scent.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    You're right. That's why I threw it out this morning.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    You did what!?!?
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    Mmm hmm!
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    You better watch out for your records bitch, cause you just about unlocked something.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    You wouldn't.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    Actually, I did already.
  </Ron>

</Dialog>

Ron pulls out his phone to show a pic of a smashed record. Mick looks at Ron appalled.

<Dialog>

  <Mick>
    You know why you're perfume is in the garbage? So it can smell like you.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    Well in that case your toothbrush can go in the garbage. Who knows where your mouth has been.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    You know, cause it's been on your man stick.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    And Jeremy.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    Like you don't like that.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    Bitch, don't make me stonewall you.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    You don't have the balls.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    Yeah, cause you like to hang on to them.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    Bitch!
  </Mick>

</Dialog>

Mick starts climbing onto run, and pulls loose his toup√©e. They're both shouting misogynistic slurs 
at each other and shouting. The therapist attempts to break up the fight.

<Dialog>
  <Therapist>
    Hey... can we... guys... guys...
    
    **BOYS!!!** Break it up. I'm not a social worker.

    ...

    Look. If we're gonna work this out, we're going to have to talk about our feelings. Okay... So 
    why don't I ask a few questions, and we can work out what everyone is feeling here.

    So. Who wants to go first.

    ...

    ...

    Alright. Ron? Why don't you tell me how you're feeling right now.
  </Therapist>

  <Ron>
    I don't know. Why don't you ask Jeremy.
  </Ron>

  <Therapist>
    Jeremy isn't here, and I'm asking you.
  </Therapist>

  <Ron>
    Hurt I guess. It's like... it's hard to understand even why he's upset. Like... I thought he liked
    Jeremy. I thought he would be happy for me. But like... I'm confused.
  </Ron>

  <Therapist>
    Why don't you ask him how he might feel?
  </Therapist>

  <Ron>
    Bitch!? How you feelin?
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    Kinda hungry. Can we get a burger after this?
  </Mick>

  <Therapist>
    Okay... Can we try again. But with a little sincerity.
  </Therapist>

  <Ron>
    Fine. Mick. Why can't you be happy for Jeremy and me?
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    He probably fucks you better.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    He doesn't fuck you good.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    Fuck, I wish. He's got that machine with that special attachment, and he won't let me try it. It's
    not for me, he says. It must be for you.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    Girl, I got a dildo for you on layaway.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    Wait? For real?
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    Yeah. I ordered it for your birthday, but money was too tight.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    Oh? So you did remember me birthday?
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    Of course I didn't. But I did really put a dildo on layaway. Here... Let me find the receipt.
  </Ron>

</Dialog>

Ron pulls out his phone.

<Dialog>

  <Ron>
    See, look. It's got that screw attachment for the machine. And not a little screw. A big screw. 
    For a big screw.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    Oh my gosh, it's even blue. You remembered to get a blue one.
  </Mick>

  <Ron>
    Well of course. You think I'm gonna make my man fuck a plain old dildo.
  </Ron>

</Dialog>

The two start making out on the therapists couch.

<Dialog>

  <Ron>
    We should probably get going. Jeremy must be getting bored in the parking lot.
  </Ron>

  <Mick>
    Yeah. I think that's a good idea.
  </Mick>

</Dialog>

The two men exit scene, and the therapist starts taking notes.
