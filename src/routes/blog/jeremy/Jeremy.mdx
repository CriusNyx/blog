# Jeremy

## Therapists office

The therapist enters the office. Inside are two men in shorts who are conspicuously looking away 
from each other.

<Dialog>

  <Therapist/>

  What brings the two of you in for counseling?

  <Mick/>

  He fucked Jeremy.

  <Ron/>
    
  He fucked Jeremy.

  <Mick/>

  How ... Rude!

  <Ron/>

  All I'm saying is he tastes better.

  <Mick/>

  *to therapist* He does, he's on that keto diet.

  <Ron/>

  Maybe if you ate less garlic.

  <Mick/>
  
  Bitch, you know you love it.

</Dialog>

A long pause follows. The therapist takes some notes, and then breaks the silence.

<Dialog>

  <Therapist/>

  Is Jeremy a friend of yours?

  <Mick/>

  A friend of his maybe.

  <Ron/>

  Girl, you were bowling with that man yesterday.

  <Mick/>
  
  You know, you could be bowling me put in the effort.

  <Ron/>

  You're just don't like my new scent.

  <Mick/>

  You're right. That's why I threw it out this morning.

  <Ron/>

  You did what!?!?

  <Mick/>

  Mmm hmm!

  <Ron/>

  You better watch out for your records bitch, cause you just about unlocked something.

  <Mick/>

  You wouldn't.

  <Ron/>

  Oh you know I would.

</Dialog>

Mick looks at Ron appalled. Then for a moment he considers Ron's threat and responds.

<Dialog>

  <Mick/>

  Trash doesn't come until Thursday. I can get it back.

  <Ron/>

  You think I wanna smell like garbage?

  <Mick/>

  Uou don't?

  <Ron/>

  Your records, and you're toothbrush. That mouth ain't clean.

  <Mick/>

  Yeah, it's been on you.

  <Ron/>

  And Jeremy.

  <Mick/>

  Like you don't like that.
