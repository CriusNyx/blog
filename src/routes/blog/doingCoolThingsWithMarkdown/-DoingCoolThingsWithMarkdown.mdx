# Doing Cool Things (with Markdown)

I'm a big fan of markdown. I think it's a really great syntax for making content for the web.
This blog is created using MDX, a flavor of markdown that supports embedding components.

I have a website for DnD notes, and I wanted to use something like MDX for that website. However,
when I looked into integrated MDX itself, it had a couple of implementation shortcomings that 
made it not suited for purpose. First, it's quite labor-some to pass in huge quantities of props.
I also wanted to be able to embed other markdown documents, which MDX can do, but MDX tends to 
provide so much power for embedding that it's easy to create embed loops, which would crash the
clients computer without special handling code. Finally, I want to add blocks to the Markdown that 
control permissions for the content, which isn't a feature of MDX.

I've made a few attempts at creating a system for addressing these things, and I'm going to present
a few of them here.

## Embedding Components

### First Approach

The first attempt I made to deal with embedded component was by targeting the link component in the
markdown doc. The solution looked something like this.

```md
# This is a doc

This is a paragraph with a [link]('/link');
```

Then in the document this link will be transformed into a custom link component doing something like
this.

```tsx
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown";

interface MarkdownProps {
  code: string;
}

function Markdown(props: MarkdownProps) {
  return (
    <ReactMarkdown components={{ a: CustomAComponent }}>
      {props.code}
    </ReactMarkdown>
  );
}
```

#### Shortcomings of this approach

This first approach had a lot of downsides. First, the only information I could embed in the 
link was it's location. And I considered targeting the link to a JSON file, but that solution just
didn't really satisfy me. It required that I do this additional work of creating and hosting all 
these additional files, and I had this system that I could use to edit he markdown on my site, but 
extending that solution to also include JSON files just didn't feel like the right solution.

### Better Approach

After sitting on the problem a little longer, I ran into a different issue that I wanted to solve 
with markdown. I had a lot of notes for Satisfactory, and I wanted a way to embed the output of a 
computer program in those notes. So I created a program called Runmark to do that. And here we see
the first insight I needed for my website.

````md

The c# is for the language server to know what language to render.
The cSharp directive at the end is actually the name of a Runmark plugin that parses and executes
the cSharp code using the Roslyn compiler and .NET runtime.

```c# cSharp
using System;

Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

```output c# cSharp
Hello World!
```

````

There were two breakthrough ideas for Runmark that were improvements over my previous solution. 
First, that directions could be encoded after the language identifier for the code block, and the 
second was that the code block itself could be used to encode data. If I used the data in the 
code block header to encode a component to render, and the body of the code block to encode 
component props as JSON then I can use that to embed components in my markdown documents.

A solution implementing these breakthroughs might look like the following.

<Row>
  <Col>
  ````md
  Here is our markdown.

  ```json MyCustomComponent
  {
    "name": "My Component Name",
    "text": "My Component Text"
  }
  ```

  ````
  </Col>
  <Col>
    <Frame title='Output'>
      Here is our markdown.

      <MyCustomComponent name='My Component Name' text='My Component Text'/>
    </Frame>
  </Col>
</Row> 

This gives us a skeleton that we can use to engineer a full solution.

## Engineering a JSON based solution

### Custom pre and code tags

The first hurdle to overcome is to engineer a custom code component that can handle this issue.
However, markdown always puts code components inside of pre components. And we don't want our
embedded components to be inside a pre, so we also need to make a custom pre component that will 
omit the child code component if it should be embedded.

```tsx
function Markdown(props) {
  return (
    <ReactMarkdown
      components={{
        pre(props) {
          // Here we just omit all pre components from the document because they interfere with
          // embedded component rendering.
          // The component injector will add the pre tag if it's necessary.
          return props.children;
        },
        code(codeProps) {
          return (
            <ComponentInjector
              // We have to explicity cast the codeProps because some of their data is hidden by
              // React Markdown, and we need to access that hidden data.
              {...(codeProps as any)}
              componentMap={props.componentMap}
            />
          );
        },
        // Additional HTML components that the app might want to customize.
        ...props.components,
      }}
    >
      {props.markdownBody}
    </ReactMarkdown>
  );
}

```

### The Component Injector

Then we can inject components by reading the properties parsed from markdown.

```tsx
export function ComponentInjector(props: ComponentInjectorProps) {
  // Meta is the part of the code block after the json
  // In this case it has our component name
  const componentName = props?.node?.data?.meta;

  // If the component exists inside the component map, we grab it.
  if (componentName in props.componentMap) {
    try {
      const Component = props.componentMap[componentName];

      // Then we parse the props out of the component.
      const componentProps = JSON.parse(props.children);

      // Finally we render that component with those props.
      return <Component {...componentProps} />;
    } catch {
      return <Error>Failed to render component</Error>;
    }
  } else {
    // If we can't find the component then we return a regular old code block instead.
    // We need to append the pre tags because they were stripped earlier.
    return (
      <pre>
        <code {...props} />
      </pre>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Examples

Here's a stat block for a Zombie taken from the SRD using my custom Autostat component.

<Row>
  <Col>
    ![stats](/blog/doingCoolThingsWithMarkdown/stats.png)
  </Col>
  <Col>
    ![zombie](/blog/doingCoolThingsWithMarkdown/zombie.png)
  </Col>
</Row>

## Improvements

There are two simple improvements I made to the solution above.

First, I used zod to validate all 
component props before rendering the component. If the zod schema fails to parse then I can display
an error instead.

Second, I also added support for yaml in addition to JSON. Hand writing JSON is annoying.

## Part 2

After the work I did on embedding components I added some other really cool features. You can read
